===============

An Arduino based F/Stop Timer and LED light head controller based on William Brodie-Tyrrell's excellent F/Stop timer, which can be found here. http://www.brodie-tyrrell.org/fstoptimer/

Basic changes from the original timer allow driving 4 banks of LEDs, two for the hard blue light, and two for the soft green light. The timer can work in both integrated mode where the hard and soft lights are on at one timer. It can also work in a split grade more where each step of the exposure is done twice, once with soft and once with hard light. This will facilitate dodging or burning with only one type of light. 

Further details on the construction progress can be found at http://www.trippingthroughthedark.com

This is very much a work in progress. Most features do not function completely, and it's possible that there will be major changes to functionality as it is developed.
