Version 0.5:
2013/05/25

Initial work to adapt to driving a variable contrast set of LEDs
Details TBD

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4:
2012/06/20

Eat Your Own Dogfood edition:
 - rotary encoder pushbutton / footswitch now supported by the software
 - USB/serial communication implemented [1]
 - fixed save-to-slot 7 bug
 - entering focus mode no longer resets program
 - backlight dimmer goes to zero for use in colour darkroom
 - rotary encoder direction can be reversed [2]
 - code updated to compile under Arduino-1.0

Notable lacks:
 - lamp warmup correction

[1] The program to run on a host PC and connect to the timer is not yet
in a releasable state but is coming "soon".  The timer permits the host
to read and write any portion of the EEPROM, i.e. to transfer stored
programs and change config settings.

[2] change ROTARY_REVERSE to 1 in fstop_driver.ino and recompile

Version 0.3
2011/10/14

First public release.  Features:
 - 0.01 stop, 1ms resolution up to 1000s
 - 6 stored programs of up to 8 steps each
 - 14-char names for each program step
 - SMS-style multi-press text entry
 - test-strip generation in equi-stop increments
 - test-strips incremental or per-tile whole exposures
 - adjustable backlight dimmer
 - direct decimal entry of EV
 - EV adjustments by rotary encoder
 - pause/restart/skip within program playback
 - builds in Arduino-0022

Limitations:
 - dodges/burns assumed to be non-overlapping
 - dodges must sum to less than base exposure

Notable bugs:
 - saving to slot 7 would attempt to write off the end of the EEPROM
 - Focus mode would reset program playback
